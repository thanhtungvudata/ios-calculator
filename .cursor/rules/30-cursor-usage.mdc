## Surfaces
- **Tabs/Inline Edit** for FOCUSED edits.
- **Chat (Agent)** for SINGLE features with EXPLICIT file references.
- **Agents/Background** for scoped, multi-step tasks *AFTER* PLAN approval.

## Context discipline
- YOU MUST always reference the EXACT files/lines to edit (use @filename & line hints).
- YOU MUST link to similar examples in the repo rather than pasting large blobs.
- YOU SHOULD prefer attaching files or pointing to repo paths over long chat dumps.

## Ignore large/noisy files
- YOU MUST keep `.cursorignore` updated to exclude large datasets, models, & secrets.
- YOU SHOULD prefer `.cursorindexingignore` to reduce indexing noise but keep files accessible when needed.

## Documentation first
- If a behavior is repeated, YOU SHOULD crystallise it as a rule or memory (see @70-memories-and-banks.mdc).

(Reference: Cursor docs on Rules, Memories, & Ignore Files.)
