## Reproducibility
- YOU SHOULD set seeds (numpy/random/torch/sklearn) & log versions.
- YOU SHOULD keep notebooks lightweight; move repeatable logic into `src/`.
- YOU SHOULD save artifacts to S3 with metadata; never to the repo.

## Evaluation
- YOU MUST separate training, evaluation, & inference modules.
- YOU SHOULD persist metrics; prefer JSONL/Parquet logs for dashboards.

## Serving
- Inference code MUST be pure & thread-safe; NO global state.
- YOU MUST validate payloads & return types; YOU SHOULD add golden tests for key endpoints.
