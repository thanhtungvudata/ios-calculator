## Keep context small
- YOU SHOULD prefer `@filename` references over pasting code.
- Summarise: YOU MUST ask to compress long context into short bullets before proceeding.
- YOU MUST split rules by topic; avoid single giant rules file.

## Indexing hygiene
- YOU SHOULD maintain `.cursorignore` to exclude datasets, models, binaries, notebooksâ€™ checkpoints, & anything secret.
- YOU SHOULD use `.cursorindexingignore` to suppress noisy files from search while keeping them accessible to the AI.

## Output controls
- For long diffs, YOU SHOULD propose patches per file instead of one massive blob.
- YOU SHOULD prefer stepwise edits with tests running between steps.

(Reference: Cursor Ignore Files & Rules best practices.)
